* Title:
  How to write a fast grep like command using modern C++
* Summary:
  This talk will start with writing a simple line counting program and
  make our program more complicated by each step using policy based
  design approach. At the end of this talk we will be able to create a
  very fast grep like command i.e it is faster than grep or
  ripgrep. As much as of this talk will focus on how to write reusable
  and high performance algorithms and some specific algorithms
  designing that makes core algorithms have greater performance than
  naive approaches.
